          Drunk Driving Deaths in the United States are Steadily Declining

          Every year, millions of automobile collisions occur in the United
          States alone. Consequentially, hundreds of thousands of people lose
          their lives -- those behind the wheel and passengers alike.
          Additionally, many of these car accidents and deaths occur due to
          driving under the influence. Among these fatalities, more than half
          were passengers of vehicles with drivers who had BACs greater than or
          equal to 0.08%.

          Fortunately, since 2012, alcohol-impaired driving mortality rates have
          been on a steady decline.

        <p>
          The decline of drunk driving mortality rates can be attributed to
          several factors including strengthening impaired driving laws and
          enforcement efforts, education and awareness campaigns, and the use of
          technology (e.g., ignition interlocks) to prevent impaired drivers
          from operating vehicles.
        </p>
        <p>
          Although all states have laws against driving while impaired, some
          states have additional measures to further discourage impaired
          driving. These measures include sobriety checkpoints and campaigns
          such as “Drive Sober or Get Pulled Over”. The states that implement
          these addtional measures, such as Maryland and Ohio, have experienced a larger drop in mortality
          rates than those that fail to do so.

          Nonetheless, the number of deaths in the United States due to
          alcohol-impaired driving is on the decline and is projected to
          contintue to do so in the future. Learn more about impaired driving laws, enforcement, and prevention <a href=https://www.transportation.gov/mission/health/Impaired-Driving-Laws-Enforcement-and-Prevention>here</a>.
